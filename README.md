# Canvas Assignment Assistant MCP Server

## Overview

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets you interact with Canvas/Instructure courses and assignments, without leaving your LLM (e.g. Claude Desktop).

It allows you to retrieve, search, and summarize course and assignment information programmatically, for example to check due dates for upcoming assignments:

## Environment Setup

Set the following environment variables:

- `CANVAS_DOMAIN`: Your Canvas institution's domain (e.g., `canvas.youruniversity.edu`)

#### How to Get Your Canvas API Token

1. Log into Canvas
2. Go to Account > Settings
3. Scroll to the "Approved Integrations" section
4. Click "New Access Token"
5. Copy the generated token

For more details, see [these instructions from Canvas](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-in-my-user-account/ta-p/615312).

### Security Note

Keep your `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` confidential. Do not commit it to version control.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

  Clone the repository
 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbcrosier/canvas-mcp.git
   cd canvas-mcp
   ```

   Install dependencies. If this throws an error, make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en).

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "canvas": {
         "command": "node", 
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/canvas-mcp-server/dist/index.js"], // cd into the repo, run `pwd` and enter the output here
         "env": {
            "CANVAS_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here",
            "CANVAS_DOMAIN": "myschool.instructure.com"
          }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**

   Open Claude Desktop and you should now see WhatsApp as an available integration.

   Or restart Cursor.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Token Invalid**:
